Having recently graudated university and decided I did not want to do chemistry (the field my degree is in) and instead wanted to work on coding and technology, spured on by a wonderful computational chemistry project in my final year, I have created this as a way for people to see the code I have created and suggest ways I can improve it since we can always learn from other people.
